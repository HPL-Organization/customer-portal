**Effective Date:** October 22, 2025

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Highland Park Lapidary Co. (“HPL”). These Terms and Conditions (“Agreement”) govern your participation in HPL live auction events (“Event”) and your use of the Highland Park Lapidary Customer Portal (“Portal”).

By registering for or participating in any Event, or by accessing the Portal, you (“Buyer”) acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement.

If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not participate in Events or access the Portal.

## 2. Registration and Eligibility

To participate in HPL live events or access the Portal, you must:

- Be an authorized customer of HPL;
- Provide accurate and complete registration information;
- Maintain the confidentiality of your account credentials; and
- Notify HPL immediately of any unauthorized account use.

HPL reserves the right to suspend, deny, or revoke access or bidding privileges at any time for security, maintenance, or any conduct deemed improper.

## 3. Binding Nature of Bids

All bids submitted during an Event are binding offers to purchase the listed item(s) at the bid amount, plus any applicable taxes and shipping fees.

- Orders **over $50** shipping within the U.S. (including Hawaii and Alaska **if shipped via USPS flat‑rate box**) **qualify for free shipping**.
- Orders **under $50** or shipping outside the contiguous U.S. may incur additional shipping charges.

Once an item is declared **“SOLD”**, the highest bid becomes a legally binding contract between the Buyer and HPL. **No bid may be withdrawn or canceled after the sale.**

---

## 4. Payment Terms

Buyer agrees to remit full payment according to the payment terms announced by HPL, including any deposit requirements or deadlines.

- Payments are processed through a **PCI‑compliant third‑party processor**.
- HPL does not store full credit card details; payment data is securely tokenized.
- By providing payment information, Buyer authorizes HPL and its payment processor to process authorized transactions using stored tokens.

Failure to make timely payment may result in forfeiture of deposits, cancellation of the sale, and/or legal action.

---

## 5. Taxes and Invoices

Applicable sales taxes will be added to the Buyer’s final invoice in accordance with state and federal laws.  
Invoices and payment records are viewable through the Customer Portal.

---

## 6. Shipping and Risk of Loss

All shipments will be handled according to HPL’s standard shipping policy. Title and risk of loss pass to **Buyer** upon shipment. HPL is not responsible for delays or damages once the carrier has taken possession of the goods.

## 7. Defaults and Remedies

If Buyer fails to comply with payment or other terms, HPL may, at its sole discretion:

- Cancel the sale;
- Resell the item(s) without notice; or
- Pursue legal or equitable remedies for recovery of loss or damages.

## 8. Data Collection and Privacy

By using the Portal or participating in Events, Buyer consents to HPL collecting and processing personal and transactional information, including:

- Event participation and communication preferences.

HPL uses this information solely for legitimate business purposes, including account servicing and event management. HPL does **not** sell personal data.  
All data handling is conducted per applicable privacy and data protection laws. See HPL’s Privacy Policy for details.

## 9. Communication Preferences

Buyers may manage marketing and communication preferences within the Portal. However, certain system notifications (such as invoices or payment confirmations) are mandatory and cannot be opted out of.

---

## 10. Security and System Integrity

HPL employs commercially reasonable security measures to protect user data, but no system is entirely secure.  
By using the Portal, Buyer acknowledges and accepts the inherent risks of online transactions and agrees that HPL is not liable for unauthorized access, data loss, or disclosure resulting from events beyond its control.

---

## 11. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Portal, Events, and all associated content are provided **“as is”** and **“as available,”** without any warranties of any kind, express or implied.  
HPL disclaims all implied warranties, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, HPL, its affiliates, and service providers are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from or related to participation in Events or use of the Portal, including but not limited to data loss, payment errors, or system outages.

## 14. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law

All disputes arising from or related to this Agreement, the Portal, or any Event shall be governed by the laws of the **Commonwealth of Massachusetts**, without regard to conflict of law principles.  
The **exclusive venue** for any legal action shall be the courts located within Massachusetts.

## 15. Modifications
