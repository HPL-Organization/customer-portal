# Highland Park Lapidary Customer Portal – Terms and Conditions

**Effective Date:** 10/22/25

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Highland Park Lapidary (“**HPL**”) Customer Portal (the “**Portal**”). By accessing or using this Portal, you agree to these Terms and Conditions (“**Terms**”). If you do not agree, you may not access or use the Portal.

This Portal is provided for the convenience of HPL customers to view invoices, make payments, manage communication preferences, and access certain events and information related to HPL.

## 2. Eligibility and Account Access

To use this Portal, you must be an authorized customer of HPL and have been granted login credentials. You agree to:

- Keep your account credentials secure and confidential.
- Notify HPL immediately if you suspect unauthorized access or account misuse.
- Ensure that all information you provide is accurate and up to date.

HPL reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to the Portal at any time for security, maintenance, or violation of these Terms.

## 3. Payment Processing and Stored Payment Information

Payments made through the Portal are processed via a third-party **PCI-compliant** payment processor. HPL does **not** store your full credit card details. Instead, your payment information is **tokenized**—a secure reference token is stored to facilitate future authorized transactions.

By submitting payment information, you authorize HPL and its payment processor to process transactions using your tokenized payment method. You are responsible for ensuring that your payment details remain valid and that sufficient funds are available.

HPL is not liable for any loss or unauthorized use of payment information resulting from actions beyond its control, including but not limited to user error, third-party breaches, or payment processor incidents.

## 4. Data Collection and Use

By using the Portal, you agree that HPL may collect, store, and process personal and transactional information you provide, including:

- Account details and contact information.
- Payment activity and invoice records.
- Communication and event participation preferences.

HPL uses this information solely for legitimate business purposes, including account servicing, payment processing, and communication preferences. HPL does **not** sell your personal information.

All data handling is conducted in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws. You can review HPL’s **[Privacy Policy](/policies/privacy.md)** (and the **[Privacy Summary](/policies/summary.md)**).

## 5. Communication Preferences

You may manage your communication preferences through the Portal. Certain **transactional communications** (e.g., invoices, payment confirmations, system notifications) are mandatory and cannot be opted out of.

## 6. Portal Content and External Links

The Portal may contain links or buttons to external content, including live event platforms or other HPL services. HPL does not control third-party systems and is not responsible for their content, security, or availability.

## 7. Security

HPL uses commercially reasonable security measures to protect user information. However, no system is completely secure. By using the Portal, you acknowledge and accept the inherent risks of online data transmission and agree that HPL is not liable for unauthorized access, disclosure, or data loss arising from such risks.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Portal and its contents are provided **“as is”** and **“as available,”** without any warranties of any kind, express or implied. HPL disclaims all warranties including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, HPL, its affiliates, and service providers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from or related to your use of the Portal, including but not limited to data loss, payment errors, or unauthorized access.

## 10. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless HPL, its affiliates, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, or losses resulting from your use of the Portal or violation of these Terms.

## 11. Modifications

HPL may update these Terms at any time. The most current version will always be posted within the Portal. Continued use of the Portal after updates constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.

## 12. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the **Commonwealth of Massachusetts**, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
