**Effective Date:** 10/22/25  
**Last Updated:** 10/22/25

## 1. Overview

Highland Park Lapidary (“**HPL**,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you access or use the HPL Customer Portal (the “**Portal**”), which allows you to view invoices, make payments, manage preferences, and access related services and live events.

By using the Portal, you agree to this Privacy Policy and consent to our handling of your information as described below.

## 2. Information We Collect

We collect information directly from you, automatically through the Portal, and from our payment and service partners.

**a. Information You Provide**

- **Account Information:** Name, email address, company name, billing/shipping addresses, and login credentials.
- **Payment Information:** When you make payments, your card details are securely processed by our **PCI-compliant** payment partner. HPL **never stores** full credit card numbers or CVV codes. Instead, a tokenized reference is stored to facilitate future transactions.
- **Preferences:** Communication and marketing preferences, event participation selections, and account settings.
- **Communications:** Messages, support requests, or other correspondence sent through the Portal.

**b. Automatically Collected Information**  
When you use the Portal, we may automatically collect:

- **Log data:** IP address, browser type, operating system, access times, and referring pages.
- **Usage data:** Interactions with Portal features (e.g., invoice views, payment attempts, preference updates).
- **Cookies and similar technologies:** Used to improve user experience and maintain login sessions.

You may adjust cookie settings through your browser; however, disabling cookies may affect Portal functionality.

**c. Information from Third Parties**

- **Payment processors** (e.g., token IDs, payment confirmations, refund status).
- **Shipping and logistics providers** (e.g., tracking numbers).
- **Event/webinar platforms** when you register or join live sessions through the Portal.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

- Provide access to your HPL invoices, account data, and transaction history.
- Process and confirm payments securely.
- Maintain your stored payment tokens for future authorized payments.
- Communicate with you about your account, orders, or events.
- Send marketing or promotional messages if you have opted in.
- Comply with legal obligations, prevent fraud, and maintain security.
- Improve the performance, usability, and reliability of the Portal.

## 4. Legal Basis for Processing (U.S. and E.U.)

We process your personal information under one or more of the following bases:

- **Contractual necessity:** To fulfill our obligations in providing Portal access and services.
- **Legitimate interest:** For analytics, security, and improving user experience.
- **Legal obligation:** To comply with tax, accounting, and regulatory requirements.

## 5. How We Share Information

We may share limited information only as necessary with trusted partners:

- **Technology vendors:** For Portal hosting, analytics, and CRM integrations.
- **Event platforms:** For live event access and attendee management.

We **do not sell, lease, or trade** your personal data to third parties for marketing purposes.  
If legally required, we may disclose information to law enforcement or regulatory authorities.

## 6. Data Security

We use commercially reasonable technical, organizational, and administrative measures to protect your data, including:

- Encrypted data transmission (**HTTPS/TLS**).
- **PCI-compliant** tokenization of payment information.
- Secure, role-based access controls within NetSuite and related systems.
- Routine monitoring and backup of system activity.

Despite these safeguards, no online system is entirely secure. You acknowledge and accept the inherent risks of internet transmission.

## 7. Data Retention

We retain personal and transactional data only as long as necessary to:

- Maintain customer account history and payment records.
- Comply with legal, tax, and accounting obligations.
- Resolve disputes or enforce agreements.

When data is no longer required, it is securely deleted or anonymized.

## 8. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:

- Access or request a copy of your personal information.
- Correct or update inaccurate data.
- Request deletion of your data, subject to legal retention obligations.
- Withdraw consent for marketing communications.

Requests can be sent to **[privacy@hplapidary.com](mailto:privacy@hplapidary.com)**. We may verify your identity before fulfilling such requests.

## 9. Communication Preferences

You can manage your email and notification settings directly through the Portal.  
**Transactional communications** (e.g., invoices, receipts, password resets) are mandatory and cannot be unsubscribed from.

## 10. Children’s Privacy

The Portal is not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors.

## 11. International Data Transfers

If you access the Portal outside the United States, your information may be transferred to and processed in the U.S., where data protection laws may differ from your local laws.
