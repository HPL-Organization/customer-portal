We continue our efforts to constantly improve the accessibility of our site and services in the belief that it is our collective moral obligation to allow seamless, accessible, and unhindered use for everyone, including those with disabilities.

## Awareness of content accessibility

Despite our efforts to make all pages and content fully accessible, some content may not yet be fully adapted to the strictest accessibility standards. This may be the result of not having found or identified the most appropriate technological solution.
